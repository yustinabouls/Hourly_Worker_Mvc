# Worker's Income Calculator ðŸ’¼

Welcome to the Worker's Income Calculator, a .NET development program crafted with love, designed to calculate the income of workers. Be it an hourly worker, a salaried worker, or a pay rate worker, we've got you covered!

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Hourly Worker Income Calculation:** We have a dedicated class `HourlyWorker.cs` to handle all computations related to hourly workers. This functionality takes into account the hours worked to provide an accurate income calculation.

- **Salaried Worker Income Calculation:** Our `SalariedWorker.cs` class manages income calculations for salaried workers. No matter the salary structure, this feature provides a reliable and accurate income estimate.

- **Pay Rate Worker Income Calculation:** This feature is ideal for workers who are paid at different rates for different tasks. It ensures the final income calculation is accurate and reflects all the hard work.

- **Ease of Navigation:** We've implemented an intuitive UI, thanks to our HomeController. It aids smooth navigation through the different features of the application.

- **Error Management:** We take error management seriously. Our `ErrorViewModel.cs` ensures that any errors encountered during the process are handled effectively and user-friendly messages are displayed.
